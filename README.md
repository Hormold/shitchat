# About
This is my first try of React Native. I'm using this project to learn React Native and to create a simple app to talk with GPT-3 like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) does.
It uses [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) API and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). It uses Expo to run the app.

# Application features
- Create account to store settings (API key, etc)
- A storage of conversations in cloud
- A chat screen to talk with GPT-3 with context remembering (like in ChatGPT)
- Settings screen to change API key, etc

# What I learned
- React Native
- Firebase
- Expo
- Firebase Cloud Firestore
